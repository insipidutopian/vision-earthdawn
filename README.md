# Vision/Detection Modes for Earthdawn 4e (Foundry VTT Module)

The following vision/detection modes are included.

- **Blindsight**
  - _Note: Blindsight is blocked by total cover. There's no total cover wall restriction type. So Blindsight is blocked by sight-blocking walls, but doesn't go through proximity walls regardless of the distance to the wall. Therefore it is necessary to use proximity walls for glass windows._
- **Darkvision**
  - Unless blinded Darkvision detects any creature that isn't invisible and doesn't have the `Umbral Sight` feat.
- **Detect Evil and Good**
  - _Note: Penetrates any wall, because there's no way to know what material the wall is made of or how thick it is._
- **Detect Magic**
  - _Note: Penetrates any wall, because there's no way to know what material the wall is made of or how thick it is._
  - _Note: Magic items are considered magical if the rarity is common or higher. Mundane items should not have a rarity. Unfortunately, all mundane items in the system's item compendium are incorrectly given the common rarity, which means that all items that originated from this compendium pack are detected as magical. So you'll need to fix the rarity of these items if before you can use Detect Magic._
- **Detect Poison and Disease**
  - Detects all creatures that have a poisonous natural weapon attack or have the poisoned or diseased status effect.
  - _Note: Penetrates any wall, because there's no way to know what material the wall is made of or how thick it is._
  - _Note: Some poisonous creatures might not be detected, because the Versatile Damage of the natural weapon attack is missing the `[poison]` flavor, which you'll need to fix yourself._
- **Detect Thoughts**
  - Detects all creatures that have an Intelligence of 4 or higher and speak at least one language.
  - _Note: Penetrates any wall, because there's no way to know what material the wall is made of or how thick it is._
- **Devil's Sight**
  - _Note: You need the [Vision Limitation]() module for magical darkness._
- **Echolocation**
  - Detects the same things Blindsight does but doesn't work while deafened.
- **Ghostly Gaze**
  - Detects anything Darkvision would but isn't blocked by walls.
- **Hearing**
  - Detects all creatures that do not have the _inaudible_ status effect and are not behind a sound-blocking walls. If the token is deafened, it cannot hear anything of course.
- **See Invisibility**
  - _Note: The ethereal plane part of See Invisibility hasn't been implemented._
- **Tremorsense**
  - Detects all creatures that do not have the _fly_ status effect.
  - _Note: Tremorsense works differently compared to core's Feel Tremor, which detects all creatures that are not above 0 elevation._
- **Truesight**
  - _Note: You need the [Vision Limitation]() module for magical darkness._
  - _Note: The shapechanger and ethereal plane parts of Truesight haven't been implemented._

_Basic Sight_ no longer detects creatures that are illuminate by light sources, which is now handled by the _Light Perception_ detection mode. Light perception being a separate detection modes allows you to configure the range of light perception. _Basic Sight_ is renamed to _Darkvision_.

---

Detection modes of tokens are automatically configured based on the actor's senses. They are overridden by the token's detection modes though.

A token gains ...

- _Echolocation_ instead of _Blindsight_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Echolocation`.
- _Detect Evil and Good_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Detect Evil and Good`.
- _Detect Magic_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Detect Magic`.
- _Detect Poison and Disease_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Detect Poison and Disease`.
- _Detect Thoughts_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Detect Thoughts`.
- _Devil's Sight_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Devil's Sight`.
  - _Note: Remove the effect that gives 120 feet Darkvision if it exists: Devil's Sight doesn't increase the range of Darkvision._
- _Ghostly Gaze_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `Ghostly Gaze`.
- _See Invisibility_ if the actor has an active effect with the name `See Invisibility`.

By default all tokens have hearing range of 30 feet.

The vision modes can be changed in token HUD. The player can select the preferred vision mode for their token and change it at any time on their own.

If a token doesn't produce any sound, give it the _inaudible_ status effect, which is right next to the _invisible_ status effect.

_Detect Evil and Good_, _Detect Magic_, _Detect Poison and Disease_, _Detect Thoughts_, _Hearing_, and _Tremorsense_ are all imprecise senses. They do not reveal any information about the detected token except for size and location.
